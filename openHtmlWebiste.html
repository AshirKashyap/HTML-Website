    Since there are over 28 species,
    the size and color varies. However, most
    barn owls measure around
      <strong>
        13 - 15 inches in length
      </strong>
    and have a wingspan of about
      <strong>
        31 - 37 inches

    The diet of the barn owl is best explained
    by the Peregrine Fund, a well-respected organization.
      <blockquote>
        Apart from rodents and other small mammals,
        Barn Owls also hunt <br /> birds, fish,
        reptiles, and insects. Barn Owls often hunt
        on the edges <br /> of woodlands, scouting for
        food from a perch or while in low, slow <br />
        flight.

  <p style="font-size:20px">
    Another cite explains how barn owls eat their
    food.
      <q>
        Small prey is usually torn into chunks
        and eaten completely including bones and
        fur, while prey larger than about 100 g
        (4 oz), such as baby rabbits, Cryptomys
        blesmols, or Otomys vlei rats, is usually
        dismembered and the inedible parts discarded.
