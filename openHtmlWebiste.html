    The diet of the barn owl is best explained
    by the Peregrine Fund, a well-respected organization.
      <blockquote>
        Apart from rodents and other small mammals,
        Barn Owls also hunt <br /> birds, fish,
        reptiles, and insects. Barn Owls often hunt
        on the edges <br /> of woodlands, scouting for
        food from a perch or while in low, slow <br />
        flight.
      </blockquote>

  <p>
    Another cite explains how barn owls eat their
    food.
      <q>
        Small prey is usually torn into chunks
        and eaten completely including bones and
        fur, while prey larger than about 100 g
        (4 oz), such as baby rabbits, Cryptomys
        blesmols, or Otomys vlei rats, is usually
        dismembered and the inedible parts discarded.

      Predators of the barn owl include large American opossums (Didelphis), the common raccoon, and similar carnivorous mammals, as well as eagles, larger hawks and other owls. Among the latter, the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) in the Americas and the Eurasian eagle-owl (B. bubo) are noted predators of barn owls. Despite some sources claiming that there is little evidence of predation by great horned owls, one study from Washington found that 10.9% of the local great horned owl's diet was made up of barn owls.[49][50][51] In Africa, the principal predators of barn owls are Verreaux's eagle-owls and Cape eagle-owls.[52][53] In Europe, although less dangerous than the eagle-owls, the chief diurnal predators are the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and the common buzzard (Buteo buteo). About 12 other large diurnal raptors and owls have also been reported as predators of barn owls, ranging from the similar-sized Cooper's hawk and scarcely larger tawny owl to huge bald and golden eagles.[54] The goshawk and the eagle-owls are on the increase because of the greater protection these birds now receive.[28]

      File:Tyto furcata, three chicks hissing and clicking, USA.ogv
      Three barn owl chicks threatening an intruder
      When disturbed at its roosting site, an angry barn owl lowers its head and sways it from side to side, or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak. A defensive attitude involves lying flat on the ground or crouching with wings spread out.[23]

      Barn owls are hosts to a wide range of parasites. Fleas are present at nesting sites and externally the birds are attacked by feather lice and feather mites which chew the barbules of the feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact. Blood-sucking flies such as Ornithomyia avicularia are often present, moving about among the plumage. Internal parasites include the fluke Strigea strigis, the tapeworm Paruternia candelabraria, several species of parasitic round worm and spiny-headed worms in the genus Centrorhynchus. These gut parasites are acquired when the birds feed on infected prey, which provide intermediate hosts for the parasites.[55] There is some indication that female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance to external parasites. This is correlated with smaller bursa of Fabricius, glands associated with antibody production, and a lower fecundity of the blood-sucking fly Carnus hemapterus that attacks nestlings.[56]"
