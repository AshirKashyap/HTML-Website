# HTML-Website
For my advanced HTML I worked in Java Script to create a button that when clicked would reveal hidden text in a block quote. I was also able to change the color of the text, add an alert when the button was clicked, and made the mouse spin in circles when hovering over the button!

My final commit for the HTML is 5a04b70! 

# CSS
For the CSS, I got rid of all the style attributes in my HTML code and moved them to a CSS file. I also added a few more style attributes, classes, and id's in addition to what I already had.

My final commit for the CSS is 5ea120f!

# Bootstrap 4
For my Bootstrap 4, I used a dynamic grid and a navigation bar. For my five other things, I used pagination to skip to different pages/sections, a jumbotron to emphasize the title, the different color styles, a different table with additional styles, and a few buttons!

My final commit for the Bootstrap 4 is 5a2bf34!

# Final HTML
For my final HTML, I made a website on the barn owl! I had two pages that could be accessed through the navigation bar at the top or the page numbers at the bottom. In addition, I used containers to neatly organize my website as well as buttons with dropdowns full of information. Lastly, I followed an E/2-column design and used colors to highlight the most important parts of my website!

My final commit for the final HTML is 7367613!
