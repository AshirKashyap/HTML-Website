# HTML-Website
For my advanced HTML I worked in Java Script to create a button that when clicked would reveal hidden text in a block quote. I was also able to change the color of the text, add an alert when the button was clicked, and made the mouse spin in circles when hovering over the button!

My final commit for the HTML is 5a04b70! 

# CSS
For the CSS, I got rid of all the style attributes in my HTML code and moved them to a CSS file. I also added a few more style attributes, classes, and id's in addition to what I already had.

My final commit for the CSS is 5ea120f!
